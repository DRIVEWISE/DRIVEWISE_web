    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a hierarchical framework with novel analytical and neural physics-driven models, to enable the online planning and tracking of minimum-time maneuvers, for a vehicle with partially-unknown parameters. We introduce a lateral speed prediction model for high-level motion planning with economic nonlinear model predictive control (E-NMPC). A low-level steering controller is developed with a novel feedforward-feedback physics-driven artificial neural network (NN). A longitudinal dynamic model is identified to tune a low-level speed-tracking controller. The high- and low-level control models are identified with an automatic three-step scheme, combining open-loop and closed-loop maneuvers to model the maximum acceleration G-G-v performance constraint for E-NMPC, and to capture the effect of the longitudinal acceleration on the lateral dynamics. The proposed framework is used in a simulation environment, for the online closed-loop control of a highly detailed sedan vehicle simulator, whose parameters are partially-unknown. Two different circuits are adopted to validate the approach, and a robustness analysis is performed by varying the vehicle mass and the load distribution. A minimum-time optimal control problem is solved offline and used for a comparison with the closed-loop results.”"

    "text": "This paper presents kinematics-structured neural networks (KS-NN) for the lateral speed estimation of vehicles. The internal structure of the networks is designed to incorporate the kinematic principles, enhancing the physical explainability and generalization capacity. Both the internal structure and training method are devised for better generalization performance. Various linear and nonlinear variants of our estimator are assessed for accuracy and robustness. The approach is validated using an openly accessible dataset with two race cars. The performance of the novel networks is evaluated against Luenberger, neural network, factor graph and Kalman filter estimators from the literature. In comparison with a Luenberger kinematic observer, our networks improve noise rejection, and overcome the well-known observability problem for low yaw rates. Compared to existing neural network estimators, our networks exhibit better generalization capacity, are more sample-efficient, require fewer learnable parameters, and their structure is physically explainable."

    "text": "This paper presents kinematics-structured neural networks (KS-NN) for the lateral speed estimation of vehicles. The internal structure of the networks is designed to incorporate the kinematic principles, enhancing the physical explainability and generalization capacity. Both the internal structure and training method are devised for better generalization performance. Various linear and nonlinear variants of our estimator are assessed for accuracy and robustness. The approach is validated using an openly accessible dataset with two race cars. The performance of the novel networks is evaluated against Luenberger, neural network, factor graph and Kalman filter estimators from the literature. In comparison with a Luenberger kinematic observer, our networks improve noise rejection, and overcome the well-known observability problem for low yaw rates. Compared to existing neural network estimators, our networks exhibit better generalization capacity, are more sample-efficient, require fewer learnable parameters, and their structure is physically explainable."

    "text": "The MPTREE is a motion primitive tree exploration algorithm for trajectory planning with dynamic obstacle avoidance. The algorithm is based on the exploration of the vehicle state space by means of a tree. The algorithm is able to generate trajectories in real-time and to avoid dynamic obstacles.\nThe motion planning and decision-making algorithms have to satisfy the following high level goals:\n\nGenerate trajectories (path plus speed profiles and actuation commands) to navigate autonomously in complex urban scenario.\nConsider communicated by other vehicles or use advance motion prediction models of other road users.\nChange the type of maneuver generated according to different vehicle categories (e.g. cars vs trucks) and according to different safety and comfort criteria."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we present a real-time non-linear model-predictive control (NMPC) framework to perform minimum-time motion planning for autonomous racing cars. We introduce an innovative kineto-dynamical vehicle model, able to accurately predict non-linear longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics. The main parameters of this vehicle model can be tuned with only experimental or simulated maneuvers, aimed to identify the handling diagram and the maximum performance G-G envelope. The kineto-dynamical model is adopted to generate on-line minimum time trajectories with an indirect optimal control method. The motion planning framework is applied to control an autonomous 1:8 RC vehicle near the limits of handling along a test circuit. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by comparing the experimental results with the solution of an off-line minimum-time optimal control problem."

    "text": "Abstract \nThis paper presents a framework to generate in real-time autonomous parking maneuvers for generic and unstructured parking scenarios. Our method is based on the solution of minimum-time optimal control problems by means of an indirect approach. In a single optimization, the framework computes parking maneuvers composed of two or more segments of forward and reverse driving. The trajectory planning tasks are solved in real-time, and a fine grid is used to discretize the domain of the optimal control problems, resulting in accurate and collision-free solutions. Moreover, we introduce a novel method to deal with static obstacles in the optimal control problems, using penalty functions defined as regularized three-dimensional clip functions. The results show the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios with narrow parking spots."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper addresses the on-line minimum-time motion planning and control of a black-box racing vehicle model. We present a hierarchical control framework, composed of a high-level non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) based on an advanced kineto-dynamical vehicle model, a low-level neural network to compute the inverse steering dynamics and a longitudinal controller for the low-level tracking of speed profiles. An off-line identification procedure, consisting of simulated manoeuvres, is defined to learn the high-level and low-level models. A closed-loop simulation is setup to control the black-box vehicle near the limits of handling along a racetrack. Simulation results are compared with the off-line solution of a minimum-time-optimal control problem."

    "section": "Abstract ",
    "text": "Abstract \nThis paper presents a framework to plan and execute autonomous parking maneuvers in complex parking scenarios. We formulate a minimum-time optimal control problem for trajectory planning, using an indirect optimal control approach. A novel smooth penalty function is devised for collision avoidance with optimal control, and an effective technique is adopted to compute an initial solution guess. The trajectory planning tasks are solved with low computational times, and a dense mesh is used to discretize the domain of the optimal control problems, resulting in accurate collision-free solutions. The planned parking maneuvers are tracked with an original pseudo-neural feedforward-feedback steering controller, which outperforms other techniques from the literature, and a feedback longitudinal controller, to drive a realistic 14-degree-of-freedom vehicle simulator. We validate the planning and tracking algorithms in challenging narrow parking scenarios, including reverse, parallel and angle parking, and unstructured environments. The framework robustness is assessed by changing the vehicle mass, the road adherence conditions, and by introducing measurement noise with realistic sensor models. A video of the trajectory planning and tracking results is available as supplementary material."
